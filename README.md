# Country-Guide-App
Country-Guide-App using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. This app consists of a search bar. The user enters the name of the country to be searched for in this input field and clicks on the search button. On hitting search, we display a list of common information about that country including an image of the countryâ€™s flag. In case the user enters a wrong spelling, we show an error message asking the user to enter a valid name. Also if the user clicks on the search button while the input field is empty, we display another error message that asks the user to fill the input field before submitting it.
